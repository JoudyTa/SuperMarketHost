This application serves two main purposes. Firstly, it enables individuals who want to sell their products to sign up, log in, and communicate with customers while displaying their relevant details. Secondly, it allows customers to browse, buy, rate, and leave feedback on products. Customers can also become sellers and communicate with other sellers.

The app was developed using Laravel as the back end, and Blade Laravel and Flutter as the front end. It employs a MySQL database and RESTful APIs with JSON responses.
